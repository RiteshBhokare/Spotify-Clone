#Spotify-Inspired Web Player (HTML & CSS)

This project is a simplified, **Spotify-inspired music web player** designed using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The interface mimics the look and feel of Spotify, providing a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience for streaming and managing music without using any JavaScript.

#### Key Features:
1. **Sidebar Navigation**:
   - The left sidebar contains essential navigation options like `Home`, `Search`, and `Your Library`. It provides an easy way to browse music content with icons powered by **Font Awesome**.
   - Users can access library management options like creating playlists or exploring podcasts.

2. **Main Content Section**:
   - Displays key sections such as `Recently Played`, `Trending Now`, and `Featured Charts`.
   - Each section includes music cards featuring album art, track titles, and brief descriptions. These cards are laid out in a grid format for easy navigation and visual appeal.
  
3. **Sticky Top Navigation**:
   - A sticky navigation bar at the top of the main content includes shortcuts for actions like `Install App` and `Explore Premium`, ensuring users can access these features quickly while scrolling through content.
  
4. **Fixed Music Player**:
   - A sleek, **fixed music player** is placed at the bottom of the screen.
   - The player includes basic playback controls (play, pause, next, previous), a progress bar, and a volume slider, all styled entirely with CSS. Users can see the current albumâ€™s cover and track details.

#### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the page and its content.
- **CSS3**: Handles layout, styling, animations, and responsiveness.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for navigation and playback controls.
- **Google Fonts (Montserrat)**: Provides modern typography.

#### Future Enhancements:
This project can be extended with **JavaScript** for dynamic features like actual music playback, playlist creation, and user interaction. Currently, it stands as a beautiful, static design template.
